# url-spider

This was just meant to be some clojure practice. Well, it was just some clojure practice. Rather unsatisfactory in fact.

The current state as of this commit is a non-working script. It runs forever because I didn't normalize URLs well, so it starts hitting url/ then url// then url/// etc.

The reason it was unsatisfactory though was because I just didn't want to do the work of URL normalization. Well that's the learning spirit right? Whether or not this was the right choice it just felt like a lot of friction so I shelved this.
